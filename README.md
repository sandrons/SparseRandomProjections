The results improve upon the guarantees for sparse random embeddings. Specifically, our bounds are explicit (as opposed to the asymptotic guarantees provided previously), and (b) our bounds are guaranteed to be sharper across all parameters, including the dimensionality, sparsity and dispersion of the data. 

The experiments empirically demonstrate that our bounds significantly outperform prior works on a wide range of real-world datasets, such as collections of images, text documents represented as bags-of-words, and text sequences vectorized by neural embeddings.
